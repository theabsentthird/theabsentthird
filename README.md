# 🌙 Absent.

**Absent.** is a 2-in-1 SaaS platform designed to help people seamlessly discover events and book venues — especially for gatherings that *aren’t centered around alcohol*. Our mission is to revive the idea of the “Third Space” — spaces that are not work, not home, but essential for social wellness and creative community.

> Built for students, tourists, and independent businesses — Absent. connects people and places in a way that’s simple, intentional, and inclusive.
